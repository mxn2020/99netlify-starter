cd your-repo-name
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
\`\`\`bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a \`.env\` file in the root directory:
\`\`\`
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-redis-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-redis-token
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions
\`\`\`

### Step 4: Run the Development Server
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

## Customization Guide

### Changing the Theme
1. Modify \`tailwind.config.ts\` to update colors and other theme variables
2. Update \`ThemeContext.tsx\` if you need custom theme logic

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new file in \`src/pages\`
2. Add the route in \`App.tsx\`
3. Link to it from your navigation components

### Creating API Endpoints
1. Add a new file in \`netlify/functions\`
2. Implement your serverless function logic
3. Call it from the frontend using the API utility

### Adding Authentication Requirements
1. Use the \`ProtectedRoute\` component in \`App.tsx\`
2. Add role checks using \`user.role\` from AuthContext
3. Add authorization checks in your API functions

## Deployment

### Deploying to Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
3. Configure build settings if needed

### Setting Up a Custom Domain
1. Add your domain in the Netlify dashboard
2. Configure DNS settings as instructed
3. Enable HTTPS
